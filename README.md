# CaesarCipher
A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher using concentric plates in C language

This is an implementation of the Caesar cipher using two concentric plates.
Encryption and decryption is done by positioning the inner plate (see 
rotateplate() function) and rotating it; the two plates allow encrypting 
or decrypting of each character (see changechar() function).
